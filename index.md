### CPSC 120

*Lab 5

Lab 5

Lap 5 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was very satisfying once I completed it. I was able to write a program that fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order. I recall that this was the first lab that I truly did by myself with the help of nobody.

*Lab 7

Lab 7 Part 2 was also one of my favorite labs because it was the hardest. I was able to write functions to calculate the value of a blackjack hand. This lab took me the longest to code. But it was very satisfying once it was completed.

*Lab 6

Lap 6 Part 1 was also one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs that used patterns with loops. I recall that I had alot of trial and error with this lab, but when the pattern was made it was very cool to see! There was a total of 22 lines that created a pattern.
